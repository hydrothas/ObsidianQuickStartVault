# Obsidian Quick Start Vault

> If you wish to carve a path to success, journaling will be key.

## Quick start guide

1. First create a new vault and call it what you want
2. Then close obsidian
3. (Optional) Even if temporarily, do `git init && git add .` inside your vault just to ensure if you need to roll back you can easily.
4. Copy over all the files & folders in this repo over the new vault (ensure you copy the hidden .obsidian as well, not the .git)
5. Reopen Obsidian, and then either accept or deny the Community plugins permissions.
6. Check to see if you have all the folders below. Then delete the placeholder note / drawing / image in each


## Overview

#### Configured
*These can be changed, just update the settings*

- Notes - All you notes by default are created here using (either  `cmd + o`, or `cmd + n`)
- Files - All images, files, etc are inserted here
- Templates - Press `cmd + t` to add a template to any page. Templates are already pre-populated, change to your liking.
- Excalidraw - Any lone standing Excalidraw files appear here. To create a new one, or convert a note press `cmd + p` then type `exclidraw` to view your options

#### Optional
*Change this as you want, or discard them, what I use but might not work for you*

- Prototypes - Excalidraw folders for apps I am busy with
- Bookmarks - Stop using your browser, instead create a note inside and then you the books marks template
- References notes - Ways to keep track of book notes
- Fleeting notes - A folder for quick ideas, I tend to find apple notes quicker to use, thus looking to deprecate it
